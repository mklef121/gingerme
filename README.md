### SQL vs NoSQL choice
Choosing a database storage engine depends on the use case and the specific domain problem at hand.

SQL databases support 
- Data consistency
- Complex queries and relationships
- Transactional integrity

NoSql Database supports
- High Scalability and distributed architecture
- Schema Flexibility
- Fast read and write operations

The payment service database, order & cart service database, inventory database, user service database should use SQL based storage engines.

The notification service can use a NoSql database.

The Search and Recommendation service should connect to a search index database that supports scalable full-text search and a data lake capable of processing user recommendations.


### Scaling Strategy

To scale our e-commerce application effectively, we should focus on infrastructure scaling, database scaling, and optimization of application.

- **Infrastructure scaling**: Ensure that our e-commerce application is deployed across servers distributed across several availability zones and that requests are properly load-balanced across all services. A global load balancer can be used so the DNS service can use latency-based routing to find the load balancer server that best fits the user's request. Lastly, services can be autoscaled depending on infrastructure metrics like CPU and Memory usage.

- **Database scaling**: As read and write operations increase, it's important to properly optimize the database layer. The first point of call will be to properly index our database and properly optimize the queries. The database can also be sharded or partitioned depending on the use case

- **Application optimization**: Our application layer can be broken down from a monolith into a microservice, this will make it easier to scale horizontally. Regularly accessed data can be stored in a cache to reduce the frequency of database access and static contents like images e.t.c should be hosted on CDNs as this will reduce latency. Application design patterns like event-driven architecture should be used so that multiple services can source the same event and process simultaneously.


### Security Considerations
Security Considerations (How would you handle DDoS attacks, API security, data encryption?).

- DDoS attacks: To prevent DDoS attacks we can implement request throttling at the API gateway. Also use a web application firewall and cloud based DDoS Protection services.
- Data Encryption: All web traffic transmission should be encrypted using HTTPS and sensitive data like password should not be stored in plain text. Users payment information like card details should be tokenized and where necessary encrypted.
- API security: User authentication should be stateless and implemented using a secure technique like JWT. The API gateway should be able to identify and validate the user making requests to other services.


## Leadership & Management Task

**Technical Memo**

**To:** Development Team
**From:** Miracle Nwabueze, Technical Lead
**Date:** 5th March, 2025
**Subject:** Monolith vs. Microservices Architectural Decision for Our New eCommerce Platform

**Executive Summary**

This memo addresses the ongoing discussion regarding the architectural approach for our new eCommerce platform.

This memo is about how we should build our new eCommerce platform. We need to choose to structure it as a monolithic or a microservices.

Since we have only three months to complete the project, we must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each option and choose a pattern that balances simplicity, scalability, and future growth for the company and the team.

This memo will do the following:  
1. Compare the benefits and drawbacks of both options.  
2. Explain which one weâ€™re choosing and why.  
3. Outline a plan in case we need to switch in the future.  
4. Team alignment and conclusion

**Monolithic Architecture: Advantages and Disadvantages**

* **advantages:**
    * **Simplicity:** Easier to develop, deploy, and debug, especially for a small team like ours with the tight deadline we have.
    * **Reduced Complexity:** There are fewer moving parts, and simple communication and messaging patterns,
    * **Faster Initial Development:** A monolith provides faster setup and deployment which takes away the need for complex CI/CD requirements. This will lead to faster development and release in the early stages.
* **disadvantages:**
    * **Scalability Limitations:** When there is a need to scale, it is hard to scale individual components. This will require a vertical increment in hardware resources.
    * **Deployment Bottlenecks:** When changes take place in any part of the application, the entire monolith will have to be redeployment.
    * **Technology Flexibility:** It will be difficult to adopt new technologies or languages that work better for a specific need.
    * **Fault Isolation:** A single failure can bring down the entire application.

**Microservices Architecture: Advantages and Disadvantages**

* **Advantages:**
    * **Scalability:** Independent scaling of individual services based on demand.
    * **Technology Flexibility:** A microservice allows us to use different technologies and languages that can address a specific need for a service.
    * **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service do affect the entire eCommerce application.
    * **Faster development cycles:** As we grow, it becomes easier for smaller teams to independently manage and deploy changes to domain services.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Complexity:** There is increased complexity in development, deployment, and monitoring.
    * **Communication Overhead:** A microservice requires very robust communication patterns between services, a fault in this communication technology can break the application.
    * **Operational Cost:** There will be more complex infrastructure needs which will spike the cost of running the platform.

**Final Decision**
Given our three-month deadline and the current team size, we will proceed with a monolithic architecture for the initial launch. This decision is based on the time constraint, team size, team budget and reduced initial complexity.


**Migration Strategy**
It's a possibility that we might migrate to a microservice architecture in the near future depending on the team growth, scalability bottlenecks, and the company's requirements. To address this in the future, we will need to plan from now, I would suggest we use a pattern called [Modular Monolith](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/what-is-a-modular-monolith) in developing our current application, this will make it easier to break it up into smaller services in the feature. 
In the case of future Migration, we can adopt the [Strangler Fig pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig) proposed by Microsoft where existing modules on the monolith are incrementally migrated to a service.

**Conclusion**
As already discussed above, we will adopt a monolithic architecture during the initial launch and we will revisit a microservices transition when scaling, flexibility, or deployment needs are required. To achieve this I will provide clear communication at every step, ensuring that everyone's thoughts and contributions are captured in any decision we take. Also, we will be providing training and courses for team members on monolith best practices and microservice architecture.


## SQL Performance & Query Optimization




Efficiently fetch products with their categories, brands, and suppliers.

```sql
SELECT products.id,
       products.name,
       products.price,
       products.stock,
       products.category_id,
       products.brand_id,
       products.supplier_id,
       brands.name     as brand_name,
       categories.name as categories_name,
       suppliers.name  as suppliers_name

FROM public.products as products
         INNER JOIN public.brands as brands ON products.brand_id = brands.id
         INNER JOIN public.categories as categories ON products.category_id = categories.id
         INNER JOIN public.suppliers as suppliers ON products.supplier_id = suppliers.id;
```


Get the top 10 most sold products.

```sql
SELECT
    products.id,
    products.name,
    SUM(orders.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM
    public.products
INNER JOIN
    public.orders ON products.id = orders.product_id
GROUP BY
    products.id, products.name
ORDER BY
    total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
The performance of the top 10 most sold products query can be improved by 
- Create index on the `product_id` column in `orders` table as posgres does not create indexes on FOREIGN KEY
- A materialized view can be used to cache this data and refreshed over time because this query will usually be run very frequently and will usually return same result over a period of time 


Fetch the latest 100 orders
```sql
SELECT
    orders.id AS order_id,
    orders.user_id,
    orders.quantity,
    orders.total_price,
    orders.product_id,
    products.name AS product_name,
    products.name AS brand_name,
    category.name AS category_name,
    supliers.name AS supplier_name,
    users.name AS user_name,
    users.email AS user_email
FROM
    public.orders orders
INNER JOIN
    public.products products ON orders.product_id = products.id
LEFT JOIN
    public.brands brands ON products.brand_id = brands.id
LEFT JOIN
    public.categories category ON products.category_id = category.id
LEFT JOIN
    public.suppliers supliers ON products.supplier_id = supliers.id
INNER JOIN
    public.users users ON orders.user_id = users.id
ORDER BY
    orders.id DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

Improvements suggestions to the database structure.
- The order has a one to one relationship to products, the structure can be improved to be a one to many relationship to products, this will enable having multiple products in a single order
- Index foreign keys columns
- The foreign key indexes should have integrity contraints like `on update` and `on delete` 
- The user identifiable information can be enhanced by adding column password to aid login and user identification.



## Follow-Up Questions


### Scaling considerations

If this dataset i have access to grows 5x, I would consider the following

1. Setup replicas: with this strategy, I would reduce the load on the primary database and have replicas that will provide read only data
2. Caching: There are frequently accessed data that can be cached so database hits become less frequent. I will introduce materialised views and also bring in key-value caches like redis
3. Database scaling: The infrastructure housing the database can be scaled horizontally by considering sharding the data or opting for a distribted SQL engine like `cockroachDB`
4. Microservice: Going microservice can help since each service will house it's related data. This will reduce the load on the primary database. Also as high traffic becomes imminent, a microservice design can scale to meet the increase.

To improve performance when running a single MySQL/PostgreSQL instance, I would do the following 

1. Index: proper indexing on frequently queried columns to speed up query reads.
2. Frequent database tuning: There are a number of tuning to be done on the database layer or the hardware to enable increased speed. This include adjusting the I/O settings like `shared_buffers` & `work_mem`.
3. Select necessary data: Reduce the usage of `SELECT *` and get the data needed for any operation.
4. Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses for pagination and to reduce the retrieved data set.

Rate limit can be done on the infrastructure level or on the Web server. Also There is an express package called `express-rate-limit` that can be used to implement rate limiting on  the application layer.
